# 🤟 Sign Language Detection

An **AI-powered application** that recognizes and interprets sign language gestures in real time using **Deep Learning** and **Computer Vision**.  
This project helps bridge the communication gap between the hearing-impaired community and others by converting hand gestures into readable text.

---

## 🧩 Overview
This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on hand gesture images to detect sign language in real time.  
The model is integrated with a **Flask web application** that provides a clean, interactive interface for testing gestures through a webcam feed.
